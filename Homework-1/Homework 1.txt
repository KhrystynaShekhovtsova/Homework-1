Homework #1

  Well, I think I would choose an Artist`s hat. 
  It`s the most interesting one because for me frontend is something between web design and engineering. On the one hand frontender is “technician”, 
the one who knows the technical side of(for example) web page, who knows JavaScript, CSS and so on. 
And on the other side frontend engineer is the guy who makes the web page really nice-looking, fancy  and comfortable for user and for his eyes ? 
Few years ago I`ve started learning some base things for web designer. Actually, I didn`t like it, I don`t know why. 
But I realize that for me frontend is “the most artistic” branch in programming.
